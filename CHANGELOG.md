# 2.0.0-beta
### Added
- `Frame.reversed` getter to automatically swap width and height for landscape orientation.
- Dynamic design frame handling based on `MediaQuery.orientation` to ensure consistent scaling.
- Improved SmartUnitUtils scaling calculations with orientation-aware design frame handling.
- Refactored ResponsiveApp for cleaner separation of error handling and screen type resolution logic.
- Enhanced debug logging for better insights on orientation and screen type changes.
- General code cleanup to improve maintainability and professionalism.

### Changed
- Scaling logic now adapts to screen orientation, reversing the design frame in landscape mode.
- Fallback mechanism added to handle null or invalid `designFrame` values gracefully.


### 2.0.0-alpha.2

### ‚ú® Features

* **Unified Scaling Extensions**: Introduced `.w`, `.h`, `.sp`, and `.rs` for simplified and auto-detected scaling across Smart, Design, and Percent modes.
* **Unified Font Sizing**: Added `.usp()` for smart-aware and unified scalable text sizing.
* **Safe Mode Execution**: Prevents crashes when required utilities are uninitialized (`_safe()` wrapper).
* **Radius Shortcut**: Added `.rs` as a unified responsive radius shortcut based on mode.

### üß† Modes Supported

* `Smart`: Context-aware scaling using screen ratios and pixel density.
* `Design`: Fixed mockup scaling via logical pixel-to-dp mapping.
* `Percent`: Percentage-based scaling relative to screen dimensions.


### üõ†Ô∏è Refactors

* Improved extension method naming consistency and formatting.
* Updated internal logic to enhance readability and maintainability.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES

* Replaced scattered utility access with `UnifiedScale().mode` for centralized control.
* Some older `.scale` usages may need migration to `.sx`, `.sy`, `.su`, or `.w` / `.h`.
